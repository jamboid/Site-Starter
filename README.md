# Site Starter

This is my personal boilerplate for beginning front-end development projects using a lightweight framework called [Fuzz](https://github.com/jamboid/Fuzz), the SCSS flavour of SASS and a library of custom JavaScript modules.

## Dependencies

- jQuery 1.7+
- Sass 3.3
- Autoprefixer

## Workflow

This boilerplate uses CodeKit 2 for its asset pipeline and the generation of the included demo pages.

### Sass Versions

The Gulp file allows for the use both the gulp-sass (using libsass) and gulp-ruby-sass (using ruby sass) packages. If you need to use the latest Sass features found in Sass 3.3, using the gulp-ruby-sass package. Otherwise, the gulp-sass is much faster and the preferred choice.
