# Site Starter

This is my personal boilerplate for beginning front-end development projects using a lightweight framework called [Fuzz](https://github.com/jamboid/Fuzz), the SCSS flavour of SASS and a library of custom JavaScript modules that use jQuery.

Also included is a basic HTML email template for creating Responsive HTML newsletters (something that my job at [Good Creative](http://www.wearegood.com) requires from time to time).

## Dependencies

- JavaScript library of useful modules is based on the jQuery framework
- I currently use the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) Mixin Library for SASS
- My workflow uses CodeKit, so Bourbon is referenced with that in mind
