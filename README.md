# Site Starter

This is my personal boilerplate for beginning front-end development projects using a lightweight framework called [Fuzz](https://github.com/jamboid/Fuzz), the SCSS flavour of SASS and a library of custom JavaScript modules.

## Dependencies

- jQuery 1.7+
- Sass 3.3
- Autoprefixer

## Workflow

This boilerplate uses CodeKit 2 for its asset pipeline and the generation of the included demo pages.

### Sass Versions

Ruby Sass is the default configuration. Libsass, the implementation of Sass in C, still isn't mature enough for me to use in production, although CodeKit has it built in if required.
