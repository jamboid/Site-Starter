# Site Starter

This is my personal boilerplate for beginning front-end development projects using a lightweight framework called [Fuzz](https://github.com/jamboid/Fuzz), the SCSS flavour of SASS and a library of custom JavaScript modules.

## Dependencies

- jQuery 1.7+
- Sass 3.3
- Autoprefixer

## Workflow

The assets are located in the root directory. A Gulp-based workflow is included that processes them and outputs demo files to a /build directory.

### Sass Versions

The Gulp file allows for the use both the gulp-sass (using libsass) and gulp-ruby-sass (using ruby sass) packages. If you need to use the latest Sass features found in Sass 3.3, using the gulp-ruby-sass package. Otherwise, the gulp-sass is much faster and the preferred choice.
